<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This is one of my favorite recipes. It is perfect for a rainy day, or for when you're looking for a quick
    comfort meal. It is quick to make, and pairs well with a grilled cheese sandwich (of course).
</p>

<p>Note that for this recipe, you will need a blender. This will be essential in whipping together all the 
    cooked ingredients for the perfect tomato soup. Enjoy!
</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>25 oz can of tomatoes</li>
    <li>1 yellow onion</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>2 tablespoon of tomato paste</li>
    <li>2 cups of vegetable broth</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon sea salt</li>
    <li>1/2 cup of cannellini beans</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons of unsalted butter</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon of brown sugar</li>
    <li>optional: basil, 10 leaves</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>In a Dutch oven or soup pot, warm the olive oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add the onion 
        and salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are tender and turning translucent, 
        7 to 10 minutes. Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 
        seconds.</li>

    <li>Add the tomatoes and vegetable broth and stir to combine. Increase the heat to medium-high, and 
        bring the mixture to a simmer. Cook for 30 minutes, reducing the heat as necessary to maintain a 
        gentle simmer, and stirring occasionally.</li>
    
    <li>Remove the pot from the heat and let it cool for a few minutes. Carefully transfer the mixture 
        to a blender, being sure not to fill past the maximum fill line (blend in batches if necessary). 
        Add the beans, butter, sugar, and several twists of black pepper. Securely fasten the lid and 
        blend the soup until smooth, being careful to avoid hot steam escaping from the lid.</li>

    <li>Since canned tomatoes vary in flavor, I always end up tinkering with this soup a bit at the end. 
        Taste and, if necessary, add a little more sugar (to balance out the acidity of the tomatoes), 
        pepper, and salt (I usually add another ¼ to ½ teaspoon).</li>

    <li>If you’re adding basil, add it now. Briefly blend again, and serve hot. This soup keeps well for 
        up to four days or so. You can freeze leftovers for up to 3 months.</li>
</ol>
