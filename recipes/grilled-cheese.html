<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This is a simple grilled cheese sandwich. It's great on its own as a quick snack, but it is a match made in heaven with a bowl of tomato soup. You will love 
    biting into this sandwich, with its crispy outside and gooey cheese on the inside. Who doesn't love cheese and bread?</p>
    
</p>
<p>Luckily, there aren't many ingredients needed to make a yummy grilled cheese. All you will need is bread, some cheese, and butter. 
    My go-to favorites are sourdough for bread and cheddar for cheese. However, you can use whatever you have on hand. Happy cooking!</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Two slices of bread</li>
    <li>4 slices of thinly cut cheese (you can add more if you are a true cheese fiend)</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon of butter</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Heat up a small skillet on the stove on a medium flame. While the skillet is warming up, butter both sides of the bread evenly.</li>
    <li>When the skilled is warm, place one slide of bread (butter side down) on the skillet. Add slices of cheese on the bread, and then top 
        off with the second slice of bread (butter side up). Place the lid on the skillet for 3-5 minutes. </li>
    <li>After 5 minutes, grab a spatula and flip the sandwich to the other side. The bottom side, now on top, should be light brown and crisped. 
        Place the lid back on top and wait another 3-5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Lift the lid and place your sandwich on a cutting board. For best dipping, cut your sandwich diagonally.</li>
</ol>
