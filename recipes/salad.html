<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This is a recipe for a quick, delicious, and simple side salad. You can have this on its own for an easy snack with some fruit, or you can pair it
    with your full dinner entree (perhaps with some grilled cheese and tomato soup - yummy!). It is fresh, tasy, and will help you pack in your veggies 
for the day.</p>
<p>For this salad, you can follow the recipe and even add in some of your favorite veggies if they aren't listed. All you really need is a leafy green base and 
    some dressing. The rest is up to you!</p>


    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 healthy handfuls of your favorite leafy greens (arugula, spring mix, kale)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of chopped cucumbers</li>
        <li>1/2 of a tomato, diced</li>
        <li>1/3 cup of red onion, diced</li>
        <li>For dressing: 1/8 cup olive oil, 1/8 cup balsamic vinegar, mixed well</li>
        <li>Grated cheese of your choice (my favorite is feta)</li>
    </ul>


<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Grab a large bowl and place 2 healthy handfuls of your favorite leafy greens (washed).</li>
    <li>Add in your chopped veggies: cucumber, tomato, red onion.</li>
    <li>Drizzle your dressing over the entire salad. No need to use the entire mixture. Dress the salad to your preference.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle your cheese on top of the salad. To thoroughly mix your salad, you can place a large plate on top of your bowl and shake the bowl
        for about 30 seconds.</li>
</ol>
